To create a Grails application you first need to familiarize yourself with the usage of the `grails` command which is used in the following manner:

[source,bash]
----
grails <<command name>>
----

Run link:../ref/Command%20Line/create-app.html[create-app] to create an application:

[source,bash]
----
grails create-app myapp
----

This will create a new directory inside the current one that contains the project. Navigate to this directory in your console:

[source,bash]
----
cd myapp
----
