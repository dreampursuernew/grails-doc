=== Quick Start with Grails Scaffolding

To quickly initiate your Grails project, you can employ the "runCommand" Gradle task. This task allows you to generate the essential structure of an application swiftly. Specifically, when running the following Bash command, you can create a link:theWebLayer.html#controllers[controller] (including its unit test) and the associated link:theWebLayer.html#gsp[views] for your application:

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew runCommand -Pargs="generate-all myapp.Book"
----
