Grails applications can be executed using the built-in Tomcat server using the `bootRun` command. By default, it launches a server on port 8080:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew bootRun
----

To specify a different port, you can set the system property `-Dgrails.server.port` as follows:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew bootRun -Dgrails.server.port=8081
----

For debugging a Grails app, you have two options. You can either right-click on the `Application.groovy` class in your IDE and select the appropriate debugging action, or you can run the app with the following command and then connect a remote debugger to it:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew bootRun --debug-jvm
----

For more information on the `bootRun` command, please refer to the link:../ref/Command%20Line/bootRun.html[Grails reference guide].
