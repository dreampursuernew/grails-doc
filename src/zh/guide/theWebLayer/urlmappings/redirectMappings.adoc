Since Grails 2.3, it is possible to define URL mappings which specify a redirect.
When a URL mapping specifies a redirect, any time that mapping matches an incoming
request, a redirect is initiated with information provided by the mapping.

When a URL mapping specifies a redirect the mapping must either supply a String
representing a URI to redirect to or must provide a Map representing the target
of the redirect.  That Map is structured just like the Map that may be passed
as an argument to the `redirect` method in a controller.

[source,groovy]
----
"/viewBooks"(redirect: [uri: '/books/list'])
"/viewAuthors"(redirect: [controller: 'author', action: 'list'])
"/viewPublishers"(redirect: [controller: 'publisher', action: 'list', permanent: true])
----

Request parameters that were part of the original request will not be included in the redirect by default. To include
them it is necessary to add the parameter `keepParamsWhenRedirect: true`.


[source,groovy]
----
"/viewBooks"(redirect: [uri: '/books/list', keepParamsWhenRedirect: true])
"/viewAuthors"(redirect: [controller: 'author', action: 'list', keepParamsWhenRedirect: true])
"/viewPublishers"(redirect: [controller: 'publisher', action: 'list', permanent: true, keepParamsWhenRedirect: true])
