==== Using the render method to output XML


Grails supports a few different ways to produce XML and JSON responses. The first is the link:../ref/Controllers/render.html[render] method.

The `render` method can be passed a block of code to do mark-up building in XML:

[source,groovy]
----
def list() {

    def results = Book.list()

    render(contentType: "text/xml") {
        books {
            for (b in results) {
                book(title: b.title)
            }
        }
    }
}
----

The result of this code would be something like:

[source,xml]
----
<books>
    <book title="The Stand" />
    <book title="The Shining" />
</books>
----

Be careful to avoid naming conflicts when using mark-up building. For example this code would produce an error:

[source,groovy]
----
def list() {

    def books = Book.list()  // naming conflict here

    render(contentType: "text/xml") {
        books {
            for (b in results) {
                book(title: b.title)
            }
        }
    }
}
----

This is because there is local variable `books` which Groovy attempts to invoke as a method.
