Since Grails 3.0, logging is handled by the http://logback.qos.ch[Logback logging framework] and can be configured with the `grails-app/conf/logback.xml` file.

NOTE: Since Grails 5.1.2 support for groovy configuration (`grails-app/conf/logback.groovy`) has been removed (by logback 1.2.9). It is possible to add back groovy configuration by adding the https://github.com/virtualdogbert/logback-groovy-config[logback-groovy-config] library to your project.

For more information on configuring logging refer to the http://logback.qos.ch/manual/groovy.html[Logback documentation] on the subject.
