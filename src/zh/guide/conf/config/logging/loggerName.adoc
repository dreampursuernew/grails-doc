Grails artifacts (controllers, services ...) get injected a `log` property automatically.

Prior to Grails 3.3.0, the name of the
logger for Grails Artifact followed the convention `grails.app.<type>.<className>`, where type is the
type of the artifact, for example, `controllers` or `services`, and `className` is the fully
qualified name of the artifact.

Grails 3.3.x simplifies logger names. The next examples illustrate the changes:
