The Grails New Command-Line Interface (CLI) has undergone significant changes compared to its previous versions, primarily focusing on code generation. One notable alteration is the removal of APIs for invoking Gradle for tasks related to building using Gradle Tooling APIs. This shift in responsibility aligns with the framework's evolution and its integration with the Gradle build system.

=== Accessing the Grails CLI

The Grails CLI (Command Line Interface) can be swiftly and effortlessly accessed by simply typing the following command into your terminal or command prompt:

[source,shell]
----
grails
----

This command allows developers to quickly initiate the Grails CLI and begin working with the framework, making it an easy entry point for those looking to start their Grails projects.

The New Grails CLI! is the preferred method for initiating new Grails projects. This command-line interface offers various options for creating projects, enabling you to select your preferred build tools, test frameworks, GORM implementation, and more. Additionally, the CLI provides commands for generating essential components like controllers and domain classes.

=== The Grails Forge Website

You can also begin your Grails application without the need to install the Grails CLI by visiting https://start.grails.org/[the Grails Forge website]. This web-based platform allows you to initiate Grails projects conveniently, bypassing the installation of the CLI.

=== Understanding the New Grails Command-line Interface (CLI)

Once the Grails CLI has been successfully installed, you can activate it using the "grails" command. For example:

[source,shell]
----
grails create-app myapp
----

A Grails framework CLI project is recognizable by the presence of the "grails-cli.yml" file, which is automatically generated at the project's root if it was created using the CLI. This file contains information about the project's profile, default package, and other variables.

Here is an example of a "grails-cli.yml" configuration for a default Grails web application:

[source,yaml]
----
applicationType: web
defaultPackage: com.example
testFramework: spock
sourceLanguage: groovy
buildTool: gradle
gormImpl: gorm-hibernate5
servletImpl: spring-boot-starter-tomcat
features:
  - app-name
  - asset-pipeline-grails
  - base
  - geb
  - gorm-hibernate5
  - gradle
  - grails-application
  - grails-console
  - grails-dependencies
  - grails-gorm-testing-support
  - grails-gradle-plugin
  - grails-gsp
  - grails-url-mappings
  - grails-web
  - grails-web-testing-support
  - h2
  - logback
  - micronaut-inject-groovy
  - readme
  - scaffolding
  - spock
  - spring-boot-autoconfigure
  - spring-boot-starter
  - spring-boot-starter-tomcat
  - yaml
----

This "grails-cli.yml" configuration sets the default values for various aspects of the Grails web application, including the application type, default package, test framework, source language, build tool, GORM implementation, servlet implementation, and a list of enabled features.

=== Grails Default Package Configuration

The project's default package is determined based on the project's name. For instance, running the following command:

[source, shell]
----
grails create-app myapp
----

Will set the default package to `myapp`.

If you wish to specify your own default package when creating the application, you can do so by prefixing the application name with the package like this:

[source, shell]
----
grails create-app com.example.myapp
----

In this case, "com.example" becomes the default package for your project.

=== Gradle Build Tool

Grails now utilizes the Gradle Build System for project management. The project's build configuration is specified in the `build.gradle` file, where you define critical aspects of your project such as its version, required dependencies, and the repositories from which these dependencies should be sourced. Here's an example of how this is done:

[source, groovy]
----
plugins {
    id 'org.grails.grails-web' version 'x.y.z' // Grails plugin
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter'
    implementation 'org.grails:grails-core'
    // Add more dependencies as needed...
}

grails {
    pathingJar = true
}
----

=== Utilizing Gradle Build Tool

To interact with your Grails project and perform various tasks related to building and running it, you should employ Gradle commands. Here are a few examples:

- Building the Grails application:

[source, bash]
----
gradle build
----

- Running the Grails application:

[source, bash]
----
gradle bootRun
----

- Listing available Gradle tasks:

[source, bash]
----
gradle tasks
----

By invoking these Gradle commands, you can effectively manage your Grails application's lifecycle.

It is important to remember that Grails leverages the power of Gradle for streamlined project management, including build automation and dependency resolution. This approach allows for greater flexibility and control over your Grails projects.
